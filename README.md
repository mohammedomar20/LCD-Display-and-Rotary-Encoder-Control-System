# LCD-Display-and-Rotary-Encoder-Control-System

This project showcases a control system built with an Arduino microcontroller, featuring an LCD display and rotary encoder. Users can navigate through various modes, adjust real-time measurements with gain and offset parameters, and track maximum and minimum values. The system includes:

Hardware: Arduino, LCD display, rotary encoder, analog sensors, push buttons
Software: LiquidCrystal library, state management, analog-to-digital conversion, debouncing logic

The project highlights embedded systems programming, interactive user interface design, and real-time data handling.
